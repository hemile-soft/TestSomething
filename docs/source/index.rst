   contain the root `toctree` directive.

TestSomething
=========================================

TestSomething is a great repository to test something. It will allow to learn something new. This introduction paragraph should summarize TestSomething's features and the program's goal. A "Next" button will lead to the installation subpage, hopefully. Hidden TOCs will be shown in the navigation sidebar.
